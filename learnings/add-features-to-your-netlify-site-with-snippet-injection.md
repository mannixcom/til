# Add features to your Netlify site with Snippet Injection

[Netlify](https://netlify.com/) allows you to add code to your site at the CDN level by using a feature called [Snippet Injection](https://www.netlify.com/docs/inject-analytics-snippets/).

Snippet injection is done without needing to update your code base, rebuilding or deploying your site. Anyone on your team can add scripts without being familar with the technologies used building the site.

From your Netlify site dashboard, you will find Snippet Injection under to **Site settings** > **Build & deploy** > **Post processing**.

Snippet Injection can come very useful for:
 - Adding analytics (eg Google Analytics)
 - Adding pixel tracking (eg Facebook Pixel)
 - [Adding Web Monetization](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2020/12/14/add-web-monetization-to-your-sites-with-snippet-injection/)

Some fun examples of how snippet injection can be used:
