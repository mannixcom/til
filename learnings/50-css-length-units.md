## Viewport

| Unit | Definition |

| svmin | The small viewport of `vmin` |
| lvmin | The large viewport of `vmin` |
| dvmin | The dynamic viewport of `vmin` |
| svmax | The small viewport of `vmax` |
| lvmax | The large viewport of `vmax` |
| dvmax | The dynamic viewport of `vmax` |

## Small vs Large vs Dynamic Viewport

- "Dynamic Viewport" is automatically sized in response to browser UI expanding or retracting.
